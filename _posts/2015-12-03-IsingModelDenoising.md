title: Denoising Images using Ising model
---
Consider the problem of reconstructing a black-and-white image (i.e. each pixel is either 1 or -1) from the corrupted observations. 
We assume that there is an underlying (hidden) noise-free image from which the observed image (Figure 1) is generated by adding noise: randomly flip the pixel values with a small probability (say 20%). Given the observed noisy image (modeled by random variable $$\textbf{Y}$$), we want to recover the original noise-free image (modeled by random variable $$\textbf{X}$$.

Consider the figure of an undirected graphical model representing a Markov random field for image de-noising (taken from [Bishop's book](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjUldT-8oLYAhWhTN8KHVBACEAQFggxMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fus%2Fbook%2F9780387310732&usg=AOvVaw1GPxHb_WuZJZR2dfgJZpJT "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning").
$$x_i$$ is a binary variable denoting the state of pixel $$i$$ in the unknown noise-free image, and $$y_i$$ denotes the corresponding value of pixel $$i$$ in the observed noisy image.
