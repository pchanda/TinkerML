title: Denoising Images using Ising model
---
Consider the problem of reconstructing a black-and-white image (i.e. each pixel is either 1 or -1) from the corrupted observations. 
We assume that there is an underlying (hidden) noise-free image from which the observed image (Figure 1) is generated by adding noise: randomly flip the pixel values with a small probability (say 20%). Given the observed noisy image (modeled by random variable $$\textbf{Y}$$), we want to recover the original noise-free image (modeled by random variable $$\textbf{X}$$.
